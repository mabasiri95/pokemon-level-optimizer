An interactive web application that calculates the optimal leveling strategy for Pokemon to reach a target point threshold while minimizing coin expenditure.

## üìã Problem Statement

You have multiple Pokemon, each with:
- A current level
- Points earned per level (varies by Pokemon)
- A leveling cost system where leveling from level L to L+1 costs L coins

**Goal:** Reach a target point threshold (e.g., 10,000 points) while spending the minimum number of coins.

## üßÆ Mathematical Foundation

### Core Formulas

**1. Current Points Calculation:**
```
Total Points = Œ£(Level_i √ó PointsPerLevel_i) for all Pokemon i
```

**2. Cost to Level Up:**
- From level L to L+1: **L coins**
- From level L‚ÇÅ to L‚ÇÇ: **Œ£(i) for i = L‚ÇÅ to L‚ÇÇ-1**

Using the arithmetic series formula:
```
Cost(L‚ÇÅ ‚Üí L‚ÇÇ) = (L‚ÇÇ-1) √ó L‚ÇÇ / 2 - (L‚ÇÅ-1) √ó L‚ÇÅ / 2
```

**3. Efficiency Ratio:**
```
Efficiency = Points Gained / Coins Spent = P / L
```
Where:
- P = Points per level for the Pokemon
- L = Current level of the Pokemon

### Optimization Algorithm

The solution uses a **Greedy Algorithm** approach:

1. Calculate efficiency ratio for each Pokemon: `E_i = P_i / L_i`
2. Select the Pokemon with the highest efficiency
3. Level it up by 1
4. Recalculate efficiencies
5. Repeat until target points reached

**Why Greedy Works:**
- Each leveling decision is independent
- Cost increases monotonically with level
- We want to maximize points per coin at each step
- The greedy choice (highest current efficiency) is always optimal

### Proof of Optimality

The greedy algorithm is optimal because:

1. **Optimal Substructure:** If we need N total levels to reach our goal, the optimal solution includes the optimal choice for each individual level.

2. **Greedy Choice Property:** At any point, choosing the Pokemon with the highest efficiency (points/coin) is always part of an optimal solution.

3. **No Backtracking Needed:** Once a Pokemon is leveled, we never need to "undo" that choice for a better solution.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(N √ó M) where N = levels needed, M = number of Pokemon
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) for storing the leveling sequence

## üìä Example

**Initial State:**
- Pokemon 1: Level 34, 65 points/level ‚Üí 2,210 points
- Pokemon 2: Level 23, 50 points/level ‚Üí 1,150 points
- Pokemon 3: Level 30, 60 points/level ‚Üí 1,800 points
- Pokemon 4: Level 29, 60 points/level ‚Üí 1,740 points
- Pokemon 5: Level 1, 60 points/level ‚Üí 60 points

**Current Total:** 6,960 points  
**Target:** 10,000 points  
**Points Needed:** 3,040 points

**Initial Efficiencies:**
- Pokemon 1: 65/34 = 1.91 points/coin
- Pokemon 2: 50/23 = 2.17 points/coin
- Pokemon 3: 60/30 = 2.00 points/coin
- Pokemon 4: 60/29 = 2.07 points/coin
- Pokemon 5: 60/1 = **60.00 points/coin** ‚≠ê

Pokemon 5 has exceptional efficiency at low levels and will dominate early leveling.
